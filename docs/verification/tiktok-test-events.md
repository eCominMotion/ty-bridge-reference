# TikTok Test Events

TikTok Events Manager provides a test events view to confirm server-side delivery.

## Steps

1) Open Events Manager and choose the correct Pixel or Data Source.

2) Go to Test Events.

3) Trigger a checkout in Shopify.

4) Confirm the event appears with the expected event_id and status.

## Notes

- If events are missing, verify consent state and destination IDs.

- Test Events are the primary signal during setup; reporting dashboards can lag.
