# GA4 Realtime and DebugView

GA4 Realtime and DebugView are the fastest way to confirm that events are arriving.

## Realtime checks
- Open GA4 Realtime for the correct property
- Trigger a test checkout in Shopify
- Confirm a purchase event appears within minutes

## DebugView checks
- Enable debug mode if needed
- Confirm event parameters (value, currency, transaction_id)

## Common reasons Realtime shows 0
- Consent denied, so identifiers are withheld
- Wrong measurement ID or property
- Event name does not match purchase
- Ad blockers or browser privacy restrictions
- Looking at a filtered view or the wrong property
