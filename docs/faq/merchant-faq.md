# Merchant FAQ

## What problem does TY Bridge solve?

It provides a consent-aware path to send checkout events from the Shopify Web Pixel surface to server-side destinations.

## Does TY Bridge replace Shopify analytics?

No. It is not a full analytics suite or attribution model.

## Does it require changes to my theme?

Not typically. The capture surface is the Shopify App Pixel, not theme code.

## Will it increase ad performance?

No guarantees are made. Platform behavior varies based on configuration, consent, and policies.

## Is my customer data protected?

TY Bridge is designed around data minimization and consent gating. See [docs/privacy-security/security-posture.md](../privacy-security/security-posture.md).
