# Data minimization

TY-Bridge collects and forwards only what is required to deliver the event correctly and to support verification.

## Principles
- Collect the minimum viable fields needed by destinations
- Prefer derived, non-PII values when possible
- Avoid long-lived identifiers unless required and consented

## Example minimal fields
- event_name
- event_id
- timestamp
- currency and value
- consent snapshot

## Retention
- Retention periods are explicit and limited to operational needs
- Deletion is supported for audit and privacy requirements
