# Contributing

Thank you for contributing to the TY-Bridge reference repository.

## Scope
- Docs-only contributions
- No production code, secrets, tokens, or proprietary internals

## Tone and accuracy
- Use calm, factual language
- No hype, no marketing claims, no revenue promises
- Avoid unverifiable or speculative statements

## Data safety
- Do not include merchant data, credentials, or identifiers
- Use placeholders such as EXAMPLE_SHOP.myshopify.com and TOKEN_REDACTED

## How to contribute
1) Open an issue describing the change
2) Submit a pull request with clear scope and reasoning
3) Provide evidence for any factual claims

## Review expectations
- Changes must be consistent with consent gating and Shopify Web Pixel constraints
- Any new claims must be test-backed or explicitly marked as uncertain
